      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>The Times UK</h3>>
        <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fashion-stores-prepare-for-new-shopping-trends-after-covid-19-lxvklrn83" target="_blank">times.co.uk</a>
        <img src="lesson2/images/times-uk-covid-thirds.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Times UK article showing picture of a shop assistant opening a door with a sign for COVID-19 safety on it">
        <p>The Times UK use this image for their article on fashion retailers preparing for new shopping trends after COVID-19. The focal point of the image is a sign on the door promoting safety against the virus. If we place a 3x3 grid over the image we will see that the elements making up the image (the sign, the door handle, and the woman line up on the vertical edges of the grid. This rule </p>

      <h2>White Space & Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/za/" target="_blank">apple.com/za</a>
        <img src="lesson2/images/apple-white-space.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Apple's home page with an image of an iPhone 11 camera surrounded by black negative space">
        <p>Apple are known for great designs. We see that implemented here on their website. The focal point being the iPhone 11 Pro and it's camera. Although the space around the image and text is not "white", the black background is negative space that allows the user's eyes to rest, as well as focus on the most important information on the page - their latest product of course.</p>

      <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
        <h3>Trello</h3>>
        <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">trello.com</a> 
        <img src="lesson2/images/trello-rectangular-repetition.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Trello's home page with round-edged rectangles and cards">
        <p>Trello is a great productivity tool. In order to be productive, you need simplicity and familiarity - or at least in this case. Trello's design repeats the rectangle shape with rounded edges, much like what we copied for our Assignment Portal home page. This repetition creates a sense of unity on their website and with their brand. As you make use of their tools, you find yourself becoming accustomed to these rectangular "cards".</p>
